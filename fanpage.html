        Ben Bridwell (vocals, guitar) formed Band of Horses, who were originally briefly known as Horses, 
        in 2004 after the break-up of his previous band, Carissa's Wierd, along with bassist Chris Early and 
        drummer Tim Meinig. They were soon joined by former Carissa's Wierd bandleader Mat Brooke (guitar, vocals).
